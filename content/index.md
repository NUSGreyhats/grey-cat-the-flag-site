### $ ctf -h

Welcome CTF is a jeopardy-style CTF for NUS students.

#### What is CTF?

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition that challenges you to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that may be hidden on the server or behind a webpage. This goal is called the flag, hence the name!

Yes, because we will verify that each team member is a NUS student if your team wins any prizes.

#### Is there a signup deadline?
You can signup anytime before the competition ends. But ideally please try to sign up before 13th August 2021 to not lose out in terms of time.
