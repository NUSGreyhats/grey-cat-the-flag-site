### $ ctf -h

#### What is CTF?

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition that challenges you to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that may be hidden on the server or behind a webpage. This goal is called the flag, hence the name!

If you are new, don't worry! We will be sharing resources in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/d9wbXEP2wN) <i style="color: #738adb" class="fab fa-discord"></i> every now and then.

### $ stat ctf

There will be two categories this year

1. Local Category consists of: NSFs, students that are currently enrolled in an educational institute in Singapore (team should consist of at least one Singapore Citizen)

2. Open Category consists of: all participants who do not qualify for the local category, participants who are eligible for the local category but opts in for the open category

There will be an onsite finals for the top 20 teams in the local category. Each team may send up to 4 people for the onsite finals.

Regrettably, we are unable to accommodate international teams for the onsite finals this year.

On the bright side, we will have attractive cash prizes up for grabs the top 3 teams in our Grey Cat The Flag Open category.

### $ stat summit

We are excited to announce that we are hosting our very own Summit this year in Singapore!
