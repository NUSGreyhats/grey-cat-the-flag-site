Grey Cat The Flag is a CTF hosted by [NUS Greyhats](https://nusgreyhats.org) in collaboration with [National Cybersecurity R&D Labs](https://ncl.sg).

#### What is CTF?

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition that challenges you to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that may be hidden on the server or behind a webpage. This goal is called the flag, hence the name!
